  abstract = {Background: The development of complex biochemical models has been
	facilitated through the standardization of machine-readable representations
	like SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied
	by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation
	SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor
	CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice
	versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process
	is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and
	specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
	
	 Results: SBMLsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via
	automated equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone
	and cumbersome process of manually assigning kinetic equations. For
	each reaction the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry,
	the participating species (e.g., proteins, mRNA or simple molecules)
	as well as the regulatory relations (activation, inhibition or other
	modulations) of the SBGN diagram. Such information allows distinctions
	between, for example, translation, phosphorylation or state transitions.
	The types of kinetics considered are numerous, for instance generalized
	mass-action, Hill, convenience and several Michaelis-Menten-based
	kinetics, each including activation and inhibition. These kinetics
	allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction
	and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to
	one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications.
	After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and
	assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in CellDesigner
	or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations can be exported
	to SBML, \LaTeX or plain text format.
	
	 Conclusion: SBMLsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating
	reactants, products and regulators when generating rate laws for
	reactions. Thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas
	are considered. This modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance
	with the diagrammatic representation. In contrast most previously
	published tools have relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators
	of a reaction, thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the
	information expressed through the process diagram. Additional material
	and the source code can be found at the project homepage (URL found
	in the Availability and requirements section).},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The XML-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has
	emerged as a standard for storage, communication and interchange
	of models in systems biology. As a machine-readable format XML is
	difficult for humans to read and understand. Many tools are available
	that visualize the reaction pathways stored in SBML files, but many
	components, e.g., unit declarations, complex kinetic equations or
	links to MIRIAM resources, are often not made visible in these diagrams.
	For a broader understanding of the models, support in scientific
	writing and error detection, a human-readable report of the complete
	model is needed. We present SBML2\LaTeX, a Java-based stand-alone
	program to fill this gap. A convenient web service allows users to
	directly convert SBML to various formats, including DVI, \LaTeX and
	PDF, and provides many settings for customization. AVAILABILITY:
	Source code, documentation and a web service are freely available
	at http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBML2LaTeX.},

  abstract = {Understanding of the logic and dynamics of gene-regulatory and biochemical
	networks is a major challenge of systems biology. To facilitate this
	research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called
	CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capabilities to visualize,
	model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two
	major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability
	to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive
	graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of
	network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a
	model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export
	SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004,
	we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example,
	we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis
	software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter
	search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users
	to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users
	can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing
	databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions
	empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also
	an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java
	and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS
	X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

	for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes

	information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical
	representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane
	transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database
	is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information
	about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded
	by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially
	useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is
	LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules
	and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing
	genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression
	maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph
	comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated

  abstract = {The KEGG Pathway database is a valuable collection of metabolic pathway
	maps. Nevertheless, the production of simulation capable metabolic
	networks from KEGG Pathway data is a challenging complicated work,
	regardless the already developed tools for this scope. Originally
	used for illustration purposes, KEGG Pathways through KGML (KEGG
	Markup Language) files, can provide complete reaction sets and introduce
	species versioning, which offers advantages for the scope of cellular
	metabolism simulation modelling. In this project, KEGGconverter is
	described, implemented also as a web-based application, which uses
	as source KGML files, in order to construct integrated pathway SBML
	models fully functional for simulation purposes.A case study of the
	integration of six human metabolic pathways from KEGG depicts the
	ability of KEGGconverter to automatically produce merged and converted
	to SBML fully functional pathway models, enhanced with default kinetics.
	The suitability of the developed tool is demonstrated through a comparison
	with other state-of-the art relevant software tools for the same
	data fusion and conversion tasks, thus illustrating the problems
	and the relevant workflows. Moreover, KEGGconverter permits the inclusion
	of additional reactions in the resulting model which represent flux
	cross-talk with neighbouring pathways, providing in this way improved
	simulative accuracy. These additional reactions are introduced by
	exploiting relevant semantic information for the elements of the
	KEGG Pathways database. The architecture and functionalities of the
	web-based application are presented.KEGGconverter is capable of producing
	integrated analogues of metabolic pathways appropriate for simulation
	tasks, by inputting only KGML files. The web application acts as
	a user friendly shell which transparently enables the automated biochemically
	correct pathway merging, conversion to SBML format, proper renaming
	of the species, and insertion of default kinetic properties for the
	pertaining reactions. The tool is available at: http://www.grissom.gr/keggconverter.},

	models with precision, (iii) quickly identify the biological phenomena
	that a given curated model or model constituent represents and (iv)
