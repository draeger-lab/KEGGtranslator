  abstract = {Tumor promoters are non-mutagenic chemicals which increase the probability
	of cancer by accelerating the clonal expansion of cells transformed
	during tumor initiation. Phenobarbital (PB) is an antiepileptic drug
	which promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents when administered
	subsequent to an initiating carcinogen like diethylnitrosamine (DEN).
	Here we have investigated the prevalence and patterns of mutations
	in two genes, Ha-ras and beta-catenin, both known mutational targets
	in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis. Liver tumors were generated by a single
	administration of DEN to 6 week old mice followed by feeding of PB
	(0.05\%) containing or control diet for 39 weeks. Mutations at Ha-ras
	codon 61 were screened by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization;
	beta-catenin mutations were detected by direct sequencing of PCR
	products spanning exon 2. In tumors from mice treated with DEN alone,
	the prevalence of Ha-ras mutations was approximately 30\% (6/20),
	while no beta-catenin mutations (0/13) were detectable in tumors
	of this treatment group. By contrast, Ha-ras mutations were undetectable
	in tumors from mice treated with DEN/PB (0/32), while approximately
	80\% (37/46) of tumors from this group showed beta-catenin mutations.
	These results demonstrate that PB strongly affects the prevalence
	of mutations in the two cancer-related genes, presumably by positive
	and negative selection for cells harboring the respective mutation.},

  abstract = {During liver development, hepatocytes undergo a maturation process
	that leads to the fully differentiated state. This relies at least
	in part on the coordinated action of liver-enriched transcription
	factors (LETFs), but little is known about the dynamics of this coordination.
	In this context we investigate here the role of the LETF hepatocyte
	nuclear factor 6 (HNF-6; also called Onecut-1) during hepatocyte
	differentiation. We show that HNF-6 knockout mouse fetuses have delayed
	expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pc), which catalyzes the final
	step of gluconeogenesis and is a late marker of hepatocyte maturation.
	Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro gain- and loss-of-function
	approaches, we demonstrate that HNF-6 stimulates endogenous g6pc
	gene expression directly via a synergistic and interdependent action
	with HNF-4 and that it involves coordinate recruitment of the coactivator
	PGC-1alpha. The expression of HNF-6, HNF-4, and PGC-1alpha rises
	steadily during liver development and precedes that of g6pc. We provide
	evidence that threshold levels of HNF-6 are required to allow synergism
	between HNF-6, HNF-4, and PGC-1alpha to induce time-specific expression
	of g6pc. Our observations on the regulation of g6pc by HNF-6 provide
	a model whereby synergism, interdependency, and threshold concentrations
	of LETFs and coactivators determine time-specific expression of genes
	during liver development.},

  pages = {261--282},
  number = {2},
  month = {Jul},
  abstract = {Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the dinucleotide
	CpG, it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain
	CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high G+C content and a high frequency
	of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In this study,
	a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were screened for
	the presence of CpG islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in
	terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides,
	and location relative to the transcription unit of the associated
	gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping
	genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some
	tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained both 5' and 3' CpG islands,
	separated by several thousand base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The
	5' CpG islands extended through 5'-flanking DNA, exons and introns,
	whereas most of the 3' CpG islands appeared to be associated with
	exons. CpG islands were generally found in the same position relative
	to the transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species,
	with some notable exceptions. The locations of G/C boxes, composed
	of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement CCGCCC, were investigated
	relative to the location of CpG islands. G/C boxes were found to
	be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and plentiful in CpG islands, where they
	occurred in 3' CpG islands, as well as in 5' CpG islands associated
	with tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. G/C boxes were located
	both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site of
	genes with 5' CpG islands. Thus, G/C boxes appeared to be a feature
	of CpG islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter
	region of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of
	a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested:
	that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a
	tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG+CpA, by the structural
	stability of a high G+C content alone, and that CpG islands associated
	with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine
	codon CGX. Neither of these theories could account for the distribution
	of CpG dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions
	of CpG islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation
	of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for
	the maintenance of CpG islands as "methylation-free zones" in germline
	DNA.},

	analysis. arrayQualityMetrics is a Bioconductor package that provides
	a report with diagnostic plots for one or two colour microarray data.
	The quality metrics assess reproducibility, identify apparent outlier
	arrays and compute measures of signal-to-noise ratio. The tool handles
	most current microarray technologies and is amenable to use in automated
	analysis pipelines or for automatic report generation, as well as
	for use by individuals. The diagnosis of quality remains, in principle,
	a context-dependent judgement, but our tool provides powerful, automated,
	objective and comprehensive instruments on which to base a decision.

	malignancy, for which there are no effective cures. Identification
	of a malignant stemlike subtype of HCC may offer patients with a
	dismal prognosis a potential targeted therapy using c-MET and Wnt
	pathway inhibitors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show promise as diagnostic
	and prognostic tools for cancer detection and stratification. Using
	a TRE-c-Met-driven transgenic HCC mouse model, we identified a cluster
	of 23 miRNAs that is encoded within the Dlk1-Gtl2 imprinted region
	on chromosome 12qF1 overexpressed in all of the isolated liver tumors.
	Interestingly, this region is conserved among mammalian species and
	maps to the human DLK1-DIO3 region on chromosome 14q32.2. We thus
	examined the expression of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster in a cohort
	of 97 hepatitis B virus-associated HCC patients and identified a
	subgroup (n = 18) of patients showing strong coordinate overexpression
	of miRNAs in this cluster but not in other cancer types (breast,
	lung, kidney, stomach, and colon) that were tested. Expression levels
	of imprinted gene transcripts from neighboring loci in this 14q32.2
	region and from a subset of other imprinted sites were concomitantly
	elevated in human HCC. Interestingly, overexpression of the DLK1-DIO3
	miRNA cluster was positively correlated with HCC stem cell markers
	(CD133, CD90, EpCAM, Nestin) and associated with a high level of
	serum alpha-fetoprotein, a conventional biomarker for liver cancer,
	and poor survival rate in HCC patients. In conclusion, our findings
	suggest that coordinate up-regulation of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster

	produces a summary measure of the microRNA expression using a linear
	model that takes into account the probe affinity effect. To obtain
	a normalized microRNA signal useful for the statistical analysis,
	AgiMicroRna offers the possibility of employing either the processed
	signal estimated by the robust multiarray average algorithm or the
	processed signal produced by the Agilent image analysis software.
	The AgiMicroRNA package also incorporates different graphical utilities
	to assess the quality of the data. AgiMicroRna uses the linear model

  abstract = {DNA methylation is an important component of epigenetic modifications
	that influences the transcriptional machinery and is aberrant in
	many human diseases. Several methods have been developed to map DNA
	methylation for either limited regions or genome-wide. In particular,
	antibodies specific for methylated CpG have been successfully applied
	in genome-wide studies. However, despite the relevance of the obtained
	results, the interpretation of antibody enrichment is not trivial.
	Of greatest importance, the coupling of antibody-enriched methylated
	fragments with microarrays generates DNA methylation estimates that
	are not linearly related to the true methylation level. Here, we
	present an experimental and analytical methodology, MEDME (modeling
	experimental data with MeDIP enrichment), to obtain enhanced estimates
	that better describe the true values of DNA methylation level throughout
	the genome. We propose an experimental scenario for evaluating the
	true relationship in a high-throughput setting and a model-based
	analysis to predict the absolute and relative DNA methylation levels.
	We successfully applied this model to evaluate DNA methylation status
	of normal human melanocytes compared to a melanoma cell strain. Despite
	the low resolution typical of methods based on immunoprecipitation,
	we show that model-derived estimates of DNA methylation provide relatively
	high correlation with measured absolute and relative levels, as validated

	DNA methylation estimates simplify the interpretation of the results

  abstract = {Cancer is caused by a complex pattern of molecular perturbations.
	To understand the biology of cancer, it is thus important to look
	at the activation state of key proteins and signaling networks. The
	limited amount of available sample material from patients and the
	complexity of protein expression patterns make the use of traditional
	protein analysis methods particularly difficult. In addition, the
	only approach that is currently available for performing functional
	studies is the use of serial biopsies, which is limited by ethical
	constraints and patient acceptance. The goal of this work was to
	establish a 3-D ex vivo culture technique in combination with reverse-phase
	protein microarrays (RPPM) as a novel experimental tool for use in
	cancer research. The RPPM platform allows the parallel profiling
	of large numbers of protein analytes to determine their relative
	abundance and activation level. Cancer tissue and the respective
	corresponding normal tissue controls from patients with colorectal
	cancer were cultured ex vivo. At various time points, the cultured
	samples were processed into lysates and analyzed on RPPM to assess
	the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 24 proteins
	involved in the regulation of apoptosis. The methodology displayed
	good robustness and low system noise. As a proof of concept, CEA
	expression was significantly higher in tumor compared with normal
	tissue (p<0.0001). The caspase 9 expression signal was lower in tumor
	tissue than in normal tissue (p<0.001). Cleaved Caspase 8 (p=0.014),
	Bad (p=0.007), Bim (p=0.007), p73 (p=0.005), PARP (p<0.001), and
	cleaved PARP (p=0.007) were differentially expressed in normal liver
	and normal colon tissue. We demonstrate here the feasibility of using
	RPPM technology with 3-D ex vivo cultured samples. This approach
	is useful for investigating complex patterns of protein expression
	and modification over time. It should allow functional proteomics
	in patient samples with various applications such as pharmacodynamic
	analyses in drug development.},

	agent. Methylation appears to influence gene expression by affecting
	the interactions with DNA of both chromatin proteins and specific
	transcription factors. Although methylation patterns are very stable

	in DNA modification. New methodologies are now becoming available
	for studying methylation at this stage and in the germ line. During

	specific and appears to involve an active mechanism which takes place
	in the absence of DNA replication. The X chromosome undergoes inactivation
	during development; this is accompanied by de novo methylation, which
	appears necessary to stably maintain its silent state. As opposed
	to the programmed changes in DNA methylation which occur in vivo,
	immortalized tissue culture cells demonstrate alterations in DNA

	A tumor initiation-promotion study was conducted in mice with conditional

	(DEN) at the age of 6 weeks followed by continuous administration

	demonstrated. PB strongly enhanced liver tumor formation in Ctnnb1
	wild-type mice, and 90\% of the PB-promoted tumors were Ctnnb1-mutated.
	A similar increase in carcinogenic response was seen when using glucose-6-phosphatase
	and glutamine synthetase as tumor markers. The prevalence of tumors
	in Ctnnb1 KO mice was approximately 7-fold higher than in wild-type
	mice, suggesting an enhancing effect of the gene KO on liver tumor
	development. However, in strong contrast to wild-type mice, PB did
	not promote tumor formation in the Ctnnb1 KO mice. Livers of KO mice,
	particularly from the PB treatment group, demonstrated fibrosis and
	massive infiltration of immune cells, an effect not seen in wild-type

	derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression

	model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for
	general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
	and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear
	models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The
	approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color
	microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived
	for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have
	robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete
	data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior
	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the
	number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has
	the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters
	which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the
	non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated
	t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees
	of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
	tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics.
	The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.

	treatment. We have now investigated by microarray analysis the gene
	expression profiles in tumors of the two genotypes. In total, 364

	changes in both tumor types. Several functional clusters were identified
	that involve changes in amino acid utilization and ammonia disposition

	metabolism in Ha-ras-mutated tumors. Moreover, several genes coding
	for inhibitory molecules within the Wnt-signaling pathway were upregulated
	in Catnb-mutated tumors, suggesting induction of a negative feedback
	loop, whereas Ha-ras-mutated tumors showed alterations in the expression
	of several genes functional in monomeric G-protein signaling. We
	conclude that mouse hepatoma cells adopt different evolutionary strategies
	that allow for their selective outgrowth under variable environmental
	conditions. Human hepatocellular cancers (HCC) lack RAS mutations
	but are frequently mutated in CTNNB1, the human Catnb ortholog. The
	set of genes aberrantly expressed in Catnb-mutated mouse tumors was

	release of this database includes 1135 records of validated miRNA-target
	interactions between 301 miRNAs and 902 target genes in seven animal
	species. The Predicted Targets component of miRecords stores predicted
	miRNA targets produced by 11 established miRNA target prediction
	programs. miRecords is expected to serve as a useful resource not
	only for experimental miRNA researchers, but also for informatics
	scientists developing the next-generation miRNA target prediction
	programs. The miRecords is available at http://miRecords.umn.edu/miRecords.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic origin of cancer at the molecular level
	has facilitated the development of novel targeted therapies. Aberrant
	activation of the ErbB family of receptors is implicated in many
	human cancers and is already the target of several anticancer therapeutics.
	The use of mAbs specific for the extracellular domain of ErbB receptors
	was the first implementation of rational targeted therapy. The cytoplasmic
	tyrosine kinase domain is also a preferred target for small compounds
	that inhibit the kinase activity of these receptors. However, current
	therapy has not yet been optimized, allowing for opportunities for
	optimization of the next generation of targeted therapy, particularly
	with regards to inhibiting heteromeric ErbB family receptor complexes.},
