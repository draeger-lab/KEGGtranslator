  abstract = {Background: The development of complex biochemical models has been
	facilitated through the standardization of machine-readable representations
	like SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied
	by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation
	SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor
	CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice
	versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process
	is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and
	specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
	
	 Results: SBMLsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via
	automated equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone
	and cumbersome process of manually assigning kinetic equations. For
	each reaction the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry,
	the participating species (e.g., proteins, mRNA or simple molecules)
	as well as the regulatory relations (activation, inhibition or other
	modulations) of the SBGN diagram. Such information allows distinctions
	between, for example, translation, phosphorylation or state transitions.
	The types of kinetics considered are numerous, for instance generalized
	mass-action, Hill, convenience and several Michaelis-Menten-based
	kinetics, each including activation and inhibition. These kinetics
	allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction
	and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to
	one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications.
	After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and
	assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in CellDesigner
	or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations can be exported
	to SBML, \LaTeX or plain text format.
	
	 Conclusion: SBMLsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating
	reactants, products and regulators when generating rate laws for
	reactions. Thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas
	are considered. This modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance
	with the diagrammatic representation. In contrast most previously
	published tools have relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators
	of a reaction, thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the
	information expressed through the process diagram. Additional material
	and the source code can be found at the project homepage (URL found
	in the Availability and requirements section).},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The XML-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has
	emerged as a standard for storage, communication and interchange
	of models in systems biology. As a machine-readable format XML is
	difficult for humans to read and understand. Many tools are available
	that visualize the reaction pathways stored in SBML files, but many
	components, e.g., unit declarations, complex kinetic equations or
	links to MIRIAM resources, are often not made visible in these diagrams.
	For a broader understanding of the models, support in scientific
	writing and error detection, a human-readable report of the complete
	model is needed. We present SBML2\LaTeX, a Java-based stand-alone
	program to fill this gap. A convenient web service allows users to
	directly convert SBML to various formats, including DVI, \LaTeX and
	PDF, and provides many settings for customization. AVAILABILITY:
	Source code, documentation and a web service are freely available

  abstract = {Understanding of the logic and dynamics of gene-regulatory and biochemical
	networks is a major challenge of systems biology. To facilitate this
	research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called
	CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capabilities to visualize,
	model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two
	major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability
	to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive
	graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of
	network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a
	model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export
	SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004,
	we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example,
	we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis
	software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter
	search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users
	to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users
	can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing
	databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions
	empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also
	an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java
	and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS
	X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

  abstract = {The KEGG Pathway database is a valuable collection of metabolic pathway
	maps. Nevertheless, the production of simulation capable metabolic
	networks from KEGG Pathway data is a challenging complicated work,
	regardless the already developed tools for this scope. Originally
	used for illustration purposes, KEGG Pathways through KGML (KEGG
	Markup Language) files, can provide complete reaction sets and introduce
	species versioning, which offers advantages for the scope of cellular
	metabolism simulation modelling. In this project, KEGGconverter is
	described, implemented also as a web-based application, which uses
	as source KGML files, in order to construct integrated pathway SBML
	models fully functional for simulation purposes.A case study of the
	integration of six human metabolic pathways from KEGG depicts the
	ability of KEGGconverter to automatically produce merged and converted
	to SBML fully functional pathway models, enhanced with default kinetics.
	The suitability of the developed tool is demonstrated through a comparison
	with other state-of-the art relevant software tools for the same
	data fusion and conversion tasks, thus illustrating the problems
	and the relevant workflows. Moreover, KEGGconverter permits the inclusion
	of additional reactions in the resulting model which represent flux
	cross-talk with neighbouring pathways, providing in this way improved
	simulative accuracy. These additional reactions are introduced by
	exploiting relevant semantic information for the elements of the
	KEGG Pathways database. The architecture and functionalities of the
	web-based application are presented.KEGGconverter is capable of producing
	integrated analogues of metabolic pathways appropriate for simulation
	tasks, by inputting only KGML files. The web application acts as
	a user friendly shell which transparently enables the automated biochemically
	correct pathway merging, conversion to SBML format, proper renaming
	of the species, and insertion of default kinetic properties for the
	pertaining reactions. The tool is available at: http://www.grissom.gr/keggconverter.},

  abstract = {Summary: The specifications of the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging computer models
	of biological processes in text files. In order to perform model
	simulations, graphical visualizations, and other software manipulations,
	an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML
	for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs,
	JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java\texttrademark{}
	programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms
	supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits
	for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java
	Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions
	through Level~3 Version~1, and we have strived to maintain the highest
	possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML.
	JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of
	plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from
	a libSBML-based backend.

	However, the two most widespread used standards for storing pathway
	data (biological pathway exchange; BioPAX) and for exchanging mathematical
	models of pathways (systems biology markup language; SBML) are structurally
	and semantically different. Conversion between formats (making data

	one-to-one mappings may lead to loss or distortion of data, is difficult
	to automate, and often impractical and/or erroneous. This seriously
	limits the integration of knowledge data and models. In this paper
	we introduce an approach for such integration based on a bridging
	format that we named systems biology pathway exchange (SBPAX) alluding
	to SBML and BioPAX. It facilitates conversion between data in different
	formats by a combination of one-to-one mappings to and from SBPAX
	and operations within the SBPAX data. The concept of SBPAX is to
	provide a flexible description expanding around essential pathway
	data - basically the common subset of all formats describing processes,
	the substances participating in these processes and their locations.
	SBPAX can act as a repository for molecular interaction data from
	a variety of sources in different formats, and the information about
	their relative relationships, thus providing a platform for converting
	between formats and documenting assumptions used during conversion,
	gluing (identifying related elements across different formats) and
	merging (creating a coherent set of data from multiple sources) data.},

  abstract = {Cytoscape is a popular bioinformatics package for biological network
	visualization and data integration. Version 2.8 introduces two powerful
	new features--Custom Node Graphics and Attribute Equations--which
	can be used jointly to greatly enhance Cytoscape's data integration
	and visualization capabilities. Custom Node Graphics allow an image
	to be projected onto a node, including images generated dynamically
	or at remote locations. Attribute Equations provide Cytoscape with
	spreadsheet-like functionality in which the value of an attribute
	is computed dynamically as a function of other attributes and network
	properties. Availability and implementation: Cytoscape is a desktop
	Java application released under the Library Gnu Public License (LGPL).
	Binary install bundles and source code for Cytoscape 2.8 are available
	for download from http://cytoscape.org.},

  abstract = {BiNoM (Biological Network Manager) is a new bioinformatics software
	that significantly facilitates the usage and the analysis of biological
	networks in standard systems biology formats (SBML, SBGN, BioPAX).
	BiNoM implements a full-featured BioPAX editor and a method of 'interfaces'
	for accessing BioPAX content. BiNoM is able to work with huge BioPAX
	files such as whole pathway databases. In addition, BiNoM allows
	the analysis of networks created with CellDesigner software and their
	conversion into BioPAX format. BiNoM comes as a library and as a
	Cytoscape plugin which adds a rich set of operations to Cytoscape
	such as path and cycle analysis, clustering sub-networks, decomposition
	of network into modules, clipboard operations and others. AVAILABILITY:
	Last version of BiNoM distributed under the LGPL licence together
	with documentation, source code and API are available at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/projects/binom},
